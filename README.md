# Terraforming AWS Infrastructure for Beginners

This lesson introduces new learners to the fundamentals of managing cloud
infrastructure with Terraform. It uses a real example of deploying a simple EC2
instance on AWS, then grows into variables, security groups, modules, and
remote backends. The lesson is written for complete beginners and follows the
Carpentries Workbench format.
